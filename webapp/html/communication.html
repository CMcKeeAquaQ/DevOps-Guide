        <h3>Slack</h3>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://aquaq.slack.com/archives/C9C04CRCM" target=”_blank”>DevOps slack chat</a> is the 
            primary place of communication for DevOps. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Here, you can communicate with the DevOps managers, who will distribute tasks, ask questions, and 
            check up on progress.
            <br>
            It is also a place where you can ask questions about anything you don't understand, or would like 
            input on.
        </p>
        <h4>Standup</h4>
        <p>
            At 09:30 each day, there will be a standup message sent to the <code class="inline">#devops</code> 
            slack channel.
            <pre><code class="block">Reminder: Standup:
    · What I did yesterday
    · What I'm going to do today
    · Any blockers?</code></pre>
        <p>
            You are expected to provide an update at this time to discuss your progress, highlight any issues
            you've encountered, as well as including other things you are working on outside of DevOps, so we
            have an idea of how busy you are.
            <br>
            <br>
            e.g.
            <pre><code class="block">Yesterday: Investigated replay of logs, functionality to calculate total PnL from start of day if stack is bounced.
Today: AWS training, post rollover functionality, replay logs functionality
Blockers: None</code></pre>
        <h4>Support Questions</h4>
        <p>
            In the slack chat, the managers will also act as clients, and will ask support 
            questions that will need to be answered. The way you reply to clients is 
            important, using a more formal writting style.
        <pre><code class="block">Dear client,

Main text body

Regards,
Devops Team</code></pre>
            <ul>
                <li>When contacting managers, a less formal style can be used.</li>
                <li>If there are any issues, or questions, communicate them here.</li>
                <li>If the production stack needs restarted, managers should be informed here when data is not available, and when functionality has been restored.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
