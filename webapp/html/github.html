        <h3>CODEOWNERS</h3>
        
        <p>
            <code class="inline">CODEOWNERS</code> is a file, found in the root directory of the repository, which controls
            who has access to push data to the repository.
            <br>
            <br>
            This should include GitHub usernames the devops team members, as well as the devops managers.

        <h3>Templates</h3>
        <p>
            Templates are files used by GitHub to allow easier creating of issues and
            pull requests.
            <br>
            <br>
            Templates can be added in the <code class="inline">.github</code> directory of the repository.
            <br>
            <br>
            These should include:
            <ul>
                <li>Sections to describe the issue or pull request.</li>
                <li>Check boxes to show that assignees have been added.</li>
                <li>Check boxes to show that labels have been added</li>

        <h3>Creating an issue on GitHub</h3>
        <p>
            Open the page to the repo that you want to add the issue to. In most cases
            this will be the DevOps torq repo. If the code is getting added to FSP then
            add the issue to that repo.
            <br>
            <br>
            On this page click on the issues tab, then click the new issue button
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/createNewIssue.png" alt="Blank issue page on GitHub">
        <p>
            Here you can fill in a sensible title, description, assign someone and give
            the issue a label. The title should explain what the issue is or can be the
            title of the question that has been asked. If it is a question, then the
            question can be copied from the DevOps slack chat. The description box supports
            markdown. In assignees, you can assign yourself or another member of your team.
            Try to only asssing multiple team members to difficult issues. Add a label to
            the issue so that at a glance it is easier to see what each issue is.
            <br>
            <br>
            The project and milestone fields don't need to be filled in, though if the issue is
            part of a project then adding this will make it easier to track.
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/newIssue.png" alt="Example of filled in issue page on GitHub">
        <p>
            After this is all filled in, click on the submit new issue button to create it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-div">
        <h3>Creating a Pull Request</h3>
        <p>
            After you have pushed your code to a new branch, you can open a PR(Pull request)
            on that code. The code doesn't need to be in a finished state to open a PR and
            it is better to open one early. This is so that the code reviewers can see how
            the code is progresing and help redirect you if the code is not going to work
            as you think it will.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are multiple ways to then open the PR. If your commit was the last one,
            then on the code tab of the repo, you will see a message about your last commit
            and at the end of it will be a button to open a new PR. Another way is to click
            on the branches tab and then click open PR beside your branch.
            <br>
            <br>
            This will open a screen as seen above. Here you have to put in a short description
            of what this PR will change in the repo. Will also need to add assigness and a
            label. If using a <code class="inline">CODEOWNERS</code> file, like DevOps does, then the reriviewers
            will be added automatically. If not, then you will need to add them too.
